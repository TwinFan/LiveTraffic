    <h2>v4</h2>

    <h3>v4.3.0</h3>
    
    <P>
    <b>Update:</b> In case of doubt you can always just copy all files from the archive
    over the files of your existing installation.
    </P>
    
    <P>At least copy the following files, which have changed compared to v4.2.1:</P>
    <ul>
        <li><code>lin|mac|win_x64/LiveTraffic.xpl</code></li>
    </ul>
    
    <P>Change log:</P>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Added <b>AutoATC</b> as a new channel to follow
            <a href="https://autoatc.zem-solutions.com/Status.html">AutoATC's generated AI planes</a>.<br>
            <i>Note:</i> As always, there is a latency as per the
            <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/configuration/settings-advanced#aircraft-selection"><i>Buffering Period</i></a>,
            which will cause a time difference between ATC communication and plane movement.
            You can reduce the <i>Buffering Period</i> to a minimum of 10s
            (if also reducing <i>Live Data Refresh</i> to 10s),
            which will however affect <i>all</i> channels and may in turn
            cause unrealistic behaviour of live planes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>ForeFlight</b> output: Added an option to only output traffic, that
            is not also a "TCAS Target" to avoid duplicates with X-Plane's network output.<br>
            If you prefer X-Plane to output data to ForeFlight directly
            (via X-Plane's Networking settings) then X-Plane will output your
            own plane's position and also up to 63 traffic planes,
            the so-called <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/article/overriding-tcas-and-providing-traffic-information/">TCAS targets</a>.
            When LiveTraffic has <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/using-lt/menu-items#tcas-controlled">TCAS control</a>,
            those are the 63 nearest planes provided by LiveTraffic.
            Using the new "Only non-TCAS target traffic" option in the
            <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/installation/foreflight#livetraffic-settings">ForeFlight Output settings</a>
            prevents LiveTraffic from sending TCAS target traffic to ForeFlight.
            LiveTraffic will then only send planes that are not currently
            TCAS targets, ie. planes further away,
            that X-Plane has now knowledge about.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixed <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/287">#287</a>:
            <b>OpenGlider</b> planes with hidden id, that
            duplicate planes from other channels, are no longer drawn,
            avoiding duplicate planes in the sky.<br>
            If you disabled OpenGlider just because of those duplicate planes
            consider enabling it again. Especially in Europe, OpenGlider adds
            to the immersion with its small planes, gliders, etc.
        </li>
        <li>Fixed <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/284">#284</a>: Allow a <i>Buffering Period</i> of more than
            100s with <b>Realtraffic</b>.</li>
        <li>
            Fixed <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/289">#289</a>:
            Reduced forced output to <i>Message Window</i> so that you can
            <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/reference/faq#can-i-switch-off-the-message-area-in-the-top-right-corner">avoid nearly all output to the screen</a>.
            However, for beginners still the default of "Info" is the
            recommended choice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Improved how planes are selected for display when seeing more than
            the configured limit. Should reduce the effect that most distant
            planes went into and out of visibility freqeuntly.
        </li>

                    This is a <strong>mandatory update for registered OpenSky users</strong>
                    as OpenSky is changing how applications like LiveTraffic are
                    authorized to use their data.<br>
                    As a registered OpenSky user who wants to use up to 4000 request per day,
                    you now need to optain a "Client ID" and "Client Secret" from
                    <a href="https://opensky-network.org/my-opensky/account">your OpenSky account page</a>
                    and load or enter those into LiveTraffic's settings.<br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Added a fallback to the Masterdata File channel to use the
                    FEB-2025 file, which remains available online.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Updated links to OpenSky's map and aircraft database to align with
                    latest changes on their web site structure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Removed links to the Route database for the moment as it doesn't
                    seem to be supported just now.

        <li>Check for New Versions
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Reimplemented check, as upgraded X-Plane.org forum
                    now requires JavaScript execution and no longer
                    supports the HTTPS check approach taken previously.<br>
                    Means: <strong>This version will again not be announced in LiveTraffic</strong>
                    v4.2.0 and earlier, future versions should again be announced in LiveTraffic.
                </li>

    <P>Change log:</P>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Added two options to <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/configuration/settings-a-c-labels">Settings &gt; Aircraft Labels</a>:
            <ul>
                <li><i>Labels for Parked a/c</i> allows to switch off labels for parked aircraft as they can quite clutter the screen on larger airports</li>
                <li><i>Dynamic Information &gt; Channel</i> adds the name of the channel currently driving the plane's data to the label</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed checking for new versions after a change to the X-Plane.org
            forum no longer allows providing version number information for
            uploads.<br>
            <strong>This means that LiveTraffic v4.1.0 and earlier cannot
            inform you about this update to v4.1.1!</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed processing OpenSky Masterdata File download and processing
            after changes to both download location and format.
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a bug preventing parked aircraft from disappearing when a
            taxiing aircraft comes too close. Is a very rare event when watching
            real world traffic, but is more likely with virtual traffic added
            to the mix.
        </li>
        <li>Added <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/193">#193</a>
            own crash reporter as per
            <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/code-sample/crash-handling/">Laminar's suggestion</a>,
            so that if LiveTraffic causes a crash there hopefully is a
            LiveTraffic-specific dump file in <code>Output/crash_reports</code>
            allowing for proper analysis.</li>

            that prevented LiveTraffic from getting current local weather information,

        <li>
            In light of OpenSky's API timeout issues, some network error handling
            is reworked. Introduced a new
            <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/configuration/settings-advanced#aircraft-selection">Advanced Setting</a>
            for <i>Min. Network Timeout</i>.
            With this version, both <i>Min.</i> and <i>Max. Network timeout</i> are set to 5s.
            This way LiveTraffic won't wait long for OpenSky not responding
            but instead will retry again sooner.

            <b>Note 1:</b> Fix effective only with RealTraffic App 9.1.202 or later.<br>
            <b>Note 2:</b> Root cause is a change in the RTTFC format definition,

                <li>
                    ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/59">#59</a>: Support for
                    <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/article/plugin-traffic-wake-turbulence/">X-Plane 12's wake turbulence</a>,
                    which is applied to TCAS targets, ie. only if LiveTraffic has TCAS control.<br>
                    So watch out...going into the wake of an airliner with your C172
                    <a href="https://skybrary.aero/articles/accident-and-serious-incident-reports-wake">may crash you</a>!
                    For training purposes, you can have X-Plane vizualize the wakes by selecting "View &gt; Show 3-D Flight Mode" from the menu
                    or hit [Ctrl-M] eight times until "Wake Turbulence" appears on the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    FIXED reading global airport scenery files, which got relocated in X-Plane 12.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            NEW <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/225">#225</a> option <i>Basics &gt; Cooperation &gt; Hide all a/c in Replay</i>
            to have all aircraft hidden while X-Plane is in Replay mode.
        </li>
        <li>
            NEW <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/223">#223</a> option <i>Basics &gt; Cooperation &gt; Hide static objects</i>
            to remove static objects like towers from all data streams where identifiable.
        </li>
        <li>
            NEW <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/18">#18</a> feature: Planes correct angle for wind, crab and de-crab for take-off/landing.
            The wind considered is taken from current simulator's weather, ie. the same that affects your own aircraft, too.
        </li>
        <li>
            General performance improvements, especially noticeable if many more
            aircraft are seen in the data than can be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
            OpenSky: NEW <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/237">#237</a> option to
            <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/installation/opensky">enter credentials</a>

            per day (<a href="https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html#limitations">details</a>).<br>
            Remaining requests per day are shown in the OpenSky status in the
            <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/using-lt/info-list-window/status-about">Status / About page</a>

        </li>
        <li>
            ADS-B Exchange: Prepare for version 2 data format (not yet available for the RAPID API interface).<br>
            Provides more data for potentially better altitude and
            type of vehicle information. Will become mandatory as the v1
            format will be phased out by ADS-B Exchange at some point in time.
        </li>
        <li>
            RealTraffic: NEW <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/229">#229</a>
            support for trafic info format "RTTFC" introduced with RT v9,
            broadcasted on port 49005, becoming the default listening port.
            Older formats continue to work, too, no matter the network port.<br>
            The network port LiveTraffic listens to is now configurable in <i>Settings &gt; Input Channels &gt; RealTraffic</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/configuration/settings-advanced#export">Export functionality</a>
            is also extended to support RealTraffic's RTTFC format:
            There is a new setting <i>Advanced &gt; Export &gt; Export file format</i>
            to choose between the previous AITFC and the new RTTFC format.<br>
            Use the updated <code>Resources/SendTraffic.py</code> to send
            AITFC or RTTFC data back into LiveTraffic.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED more potential Ground Vehicles to <code>FlightModels.prf</code>, thanks to @sawiczja and @larsras.
        </li>
        <li>
            FSCharter channel: FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/231">#231</a> static link to flight board.
        </li>

    <P>Change log:</P>

        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED links to follow a flight on the web sites of the feeding channels.

    </ul>

    <h2>v2.5</h2>

    <h3>v2.53</h3>

    <P>
        This update is meant to better deal with the fact that OpenSky
        lately started to respond sloppy (delayed or even timed out),
        leading to LiveTraffic stopping to read from OpenSky.
        It can't fix OpenSky server response time, but it tries to keep LiveTraffic
        afloat even while facing slow replies.<br>
        Also verify that <i><a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/configuration/settings-advanced#aircraft-selection">Settings > Advanced > Aircraft Selection</a> > Buffering Period</i>
        is at least set to 90 seconds to provide for ample buffer for periods
        OpenSky does not respond.

    <ul>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/219">#219</a>:
            Network timeouts are handled more dynamically and gracefully and don't lead to
            channel inactivation any longer.<br>
            Aircraft master data is fetched in order of distance, so that closest
            aircraft appear in proper livery first.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/215">#215</a>:
            Channels, which got inactivated after too many errors, can be
            restarted (from <i>Settings > Input Channels</i> and from <i>Status / About</i>).<br>
            Stopped channels are no longer treated and saved as "disabled" and therefor
            will appear enabled after X-Plane restart.
        </li>
        <li>

            they shall now roll out to a complete stop again before
            being removed.
        <li>
            FIXED validation of tracking data of planes for which ICAO aircraft
            type could be determined from model text only, reducing amount of
            discarded data, increasing number of displayed GA / Business planes
            with no aircraft record at OpenSky.

            ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/XPMP2/issues/4">XPMP2 Issue #4</a>
            a built-in way of enhancing the CSL models, which previously
            was done through the <code>CSL2XSB.py</code> script. LiveTraffic
            now creates necessary copies of .obj files on the fly just before
            loading them.<br>
            New <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/configuration/settings-csl#modelling-options">CSL Setting</a>
            <i>Enhance models, copies files</i> controls if such copies are created;
            requires restart to take effect.<br>
            If you ever used <code>CSL2XSB.py</code>, then execute the provided
            <code>Resources/RestoreOrig.py</code> script to restore original
            CSL model versions. This removes most of what <code>CSL2XSB.py</code>
            had created, but also what LiveTraffic from now on
            creates on-the-fly, ie. it can serve as cleanup at any time.<br>
            If you use <a href="https://csl.x-air.ru/?lang_id=43">X-CSL models</a>

            handling of aircraft altitude:
            LiveTraffic now takes <i>barometric</i> altitude from channels
            instead of <i>geometric</i>, requests current weather from

            and corrects altitude internally.
            While more complex, this approach proved to be more accurate and should
            reduce number of long landings.

            <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/forums/topic/218238-injecting-own-traffic-data-into-live-traffic-plugin/">Here is</a>
            how that exercise started!
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED TCAS fallback: In X-Plane versions prior to 11.50b8,
            LiveTraffic/XPMP2 falls back to the previous concept of TCAS provisioning,
            namely AI/multiplayer planes, so that TCAS is again available
            also in XP11.41 and before;
            requiring setup of AI Aircraft, though, in most cases.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED TCAS slotting, ie. planes will as much as possible try to
            stay in one TCAS target (resp. AI/multiplayer) slot to make it
            easier for 3rd party plugins to follow one single plane.
            Certainly <a href="https://twinfan.github.io/XPMP2/TCAS.html#slotting">has limits</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED: LiveTraffic/XPMP2 understand PilotEdge's format of the
            <code>xsb_aircraft.txt</code> file, allowing LiveTraffic to read
            PE's CSL models directly, no conversion required.<br>
            Note that PE's CSL models might be subject to copyright and/or
            license restrictions. Check your PE license information.

    <ul>
        <li>
            FIXED crash (Windows only, with no dump or log entry) when aircraft id
            (registration, flight number, call sign) is 8 characters or more
            while TCAS is on.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED matching of models with no entry in <code>related.txt</code>:
            They are now compared to all models and not only to other models
            with no <code>related.txt</code> entry.

            REACTIVATED LiveTraffic's map layer as XPD-10825 is fixed in XP11.50
            Beta 10. Make sure you have updated to Beta 10!
        </li>
        <li>
            ENHANCED handling of acquiring TCAS control:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If LiveTraffic cannot immediately get TCAS/AI control,
                    then the currently controlling plugin is named in the
                    info message and LiveTraffic tries again automatically
                    once TCAS control becomes available, ie. the other plugin
                    releases it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If another plugin requests TCAS control while LiveTraffic
                    holds it, a message is displayed for the user to decide.
                    As LiveTraffic shows real-world traffic it is not
                    required to give up control immediately.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/XPMP2/issues/10">XPMP2 #10</a>:
            Multiple ICAO/AIRLINE/LIVERY/MATCHES lines supported in
            <code>xsb_aircraft.txt</code>, ie. one model can match with different
            criteria.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>CSL2XSB.py</code> now comments out aircraft with old formats
            and removes more unneeded commands (HASGEAR, TEXTURE)
            to reduce log warnings during LiveTraffic startup.<br>
            Execute <code>CSL2XSB.py</code> again on your models to benefit
            from this change.
        </li>

            CHANGED TCAS handling to new
            <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/article/overriding-tcas-and-providing-traffic-information/">TCAS override</a>
            approach that was introduced with X-Plane 11.50 Beta 8.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    TCAS functionality <strong>requires X-Plane 11.50b8</strong> or later.
                    On earlier version TCAS can no longer be activated.
                </li>
                <li>Up to 63 TCAS blibs will show on Laminar's instruments.</li>
                <li>
                    You <strong>no longer need to configure AI Aircraft</strong>
                    in X-Plane's settings just for LiveTraffic's purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other plugins' TCAS implementations as well as 3rd party plugins
                    currently accessing the classic up to 19 multiplayer
                    dataRefs will first need to adapt to the new approach
                    to benefit from the up to 63 planes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Attention developers,</strong>
                    if using LiveTraffic's AI multiplayer data:
                    The previous slotting mechanism is removed, that means
                    that planes can potentially change AI slots with every
                    flight loop cycle. They are sorted by distance.
                    This is because the new
                    <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/article/overriding-tcas-and-providing-traffic-information/">TCAS target mechanism</a>
                    offers the <code>sim/cockpit2/tcas/targets/modeS_id[64]</code>
                    dataRef array to keep track of an aircraft's identity.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            TEMPORARILY DEACTIVATED LiveTraffic's own rendering of the map due to a
            bug in X-Plane 11.50b9, causing crashes when the location changes.
            Instead, X-Plane's rendering of the now up to 63 TCAS planes
            is activated so that you see at least some standard icons.<br>
            Bug is filed with Laminar. Map will come back once that bug is fixed.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/186">#186</a>
            identification of ground vehicles, takes operator and call sign
            into consideration. Call sign matches configured in

        <li>
            FIXED identification of ground vehicles for the purpose of chosing a map icon
            if car ICAO type is configured different from standard ZZZC.
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/XPMP2/issues/9">XPMP2 #9</a>:
            Allowing models with same name from different CSL packages.
            Matching will pick randomly, also across packages.<br>
            This removes many "Duplicate model" warnings from the log.
            It remains a warning if the same name is reused within one
            package.

            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/184">#184</a>:
            Aircraft on the ground, for which no updates are available any longer,
            were not properly removed but could just sit there forever.
        </li>
        <li>
            REMOVED handling of <code>ICAO</code>/<code>AIRLINE</code> lines from
            <code>CSL2XSB.py</code>, which previously was meant to define default models
            per aircraft type and airline. With XPMP2's random pick mechanism this is no longer needed
            and would even reduce the match quality of the models previously chosen as defaults.<br>

                This will show correct livery more often at the price of

            FIXED handling of OpenSky master data, avoiding duplicate requests.
            Reduces likelihood of HTTP 503 error and improves handling of it.

            UPDATED <code>Doc8643.txt</code> and <code>related.txt</code> to
            include new ICAO aircraft type codes like B3XM (B737 MAX 10)

            a crash in X-Plane startup after failed initalization of LiveTraffic
            (again), e.g. due to invalid configuration file.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED some aspects of <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/100">#100</a>,
            snapping to taxiways, already. Few changes to aircraft behaviour
            will be visible yet. But LiveTraffic already reads scenery
            information to learn about runways and taxiways.
            Auto-land aircraft will more often and more accuractely find
            a runway. But the main part, avoiding cutting corners when
            leaving the runway for a taxiway or turning tight corners, is not yet in.

        <h3>v0.91.190120 Public Beta</h3>

        <b>To update coming from 0.90</b> or ealier:

        <ul>
            <li>
                The v0.91 package now ships with a directory <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/ShippedCSL</code>,
                which contains the X-CSL FollowMe Car courtesy of X-CSL.
                Move <code>ShippedCSL</code>
                under the existing <code>LiveTraffic/Resources</code> directory,
                in parallel to the existing <code>CSL</code> directory with the
                Bluebell installation.
            <li>
                If you had installed the X-CSL FollowMe car manually, then remove
                it now by deleting the <code>CARS</code> directory from
                your <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code> directory.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you ever had trouble with "ghost planes" (seeing yellow labels
                without aircraft) then likely your Bluebell CSL installation has been
                damaged, possibly by the X-CSL installation. Recommendation is
                to start over: Clear the <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code>
                directory and download the Bluebell package once again,
                following the
                <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/installation#bluebell-obj8-csl-packages">installation documentation</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <P>
        Resulting folder structure shall be:
<pre><code>
    LiveTraffic
    - 64              (.xpl binaries)
    - Resources
      - CSL           (for Bluebell installation)
      - ShippedCSL
        - XCSL_CARS   (contains the FollowMe car as included in the package now)
</code></pre>

    <P>Release content:</P>

    <ul>
        <li>
            ADDED FollowMe Car into the LiveTraffic package, courtesy of X-CSL.
            No need to install this model any longer from X-CSL.
        </li>

    <h3>v0.90.190118 Public Beta - Hot Fix</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            ADDED a delay between requests to OpenSky Master data channel to
            avoid HTTP 503 Service Unavailable responses.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED error handling of OpenSky Master data channel, so that too
            many errors now do lead to channel deactivation as per design.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED requesting routes from OpenSky: Don't query call signs with spaces
            as they lead to HTTP 400 Bad Request. (Could probably be replaced
            with &percnt;20, but for these call signs there aren't any routes anyway
            so just safe that network traffic.)
        </li>

            flight route number and routing information from OpenSky,
            which takes priority over routing info from ADS-B Exchange.
            This is the first time flight numbers of commercial flights
            become available. Note that such info is manually maintained by
            OpenSky supporters based on call signs. You can report wrong routes
            in the flight detail window of their
            <a href="https://opensky-network.org/network/explorer">OpenSky Explorer</a>

        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/66">#66</a>,
            which removes deprecated code for Macs around file system access.
            This is pure code refactoring and shall not influence functionality.

            aircraft too high on final and turning 180 degrees on touch-down (I hope).
            This is yet another significant change to the handling, analysis, cleansing, and
            landing/take off prediction code of flight tracking data.
            New isse will require new data for analysis.
        </li>

            Label text size with HDR and antialiasing settings SSAA and higher.
            Involves a hack of reading <code>X-Plane.prf</code> file to find out

            "Antialiasing" sliders in XP11.

            In a multi-channel configuration, OpenSky now has priority when

            'see' an aircraft before it is actually created then OpenSky

            channel stopped feeding and (b) the new position is in a
            reasonable direction to prevent 180 degree turns.<br>
            As channels aren't time-synched LT needs to make up for the
            reported time difference with unusual slow/fast plane movements.<br>
            A channel switch will be document with a DEBUG-level <code>Log.txt</code>
            entry like <code>
                DEBUG AA73C3 (SWA1730): SWITCHED CHANNEL from
                'ADSB Exchange Live Online' to 'OpenSky Live Online'

            <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/58">#58</a>:
            Flight data cleansing introduced, which tries to remove
            ill-looking positions from the position queue.
            This shall lead to a lot less 180 degree turns and other
            weird movements. It will not remove all weird behaviour, though.<br>
            A position removal will be document with a DEBUG-level <code>Log.txt</code>

            ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/37">#37 (still open)</a>:
            A/c info wnd displays origin/dest airport info as reported
            by ADS-B-Exchange. No interpretation...if wrong refer to ADSBEx.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/64">#64</a>:
            Fixed using correct altitude value from OpenSky stream,
            specifically: geo altitude instead of barometric altitude.
            Should lead to OpenSky a/c better hit runway threshold.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED: Enhancements to take-off prediction. Should more often and
            more smoothly see rotate phase right before take off.

            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/56">#56</a>

            containing spaces. Tested/fixed full path usage on Mac.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED Config file entries for <code>DEFAULT_AC_TYPE A320</code> and
            <code>DEFAULT_CAR_TYPE ZZZC</code> to <code>LiveTraffic.prf</code>
            to specify ICAO types to use when (a) no a/c type could be
            determined and (b) for cars.

            using the type configured with <code>DEFAULT_CAR_TYPE</code> in
            <code>LiveTraffic.prf</code>. Requires such a type as a

            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/44">#44 (still open)</a>
            a bug in Multiplayer Lib preventing to find a match based
            on Doc8643 aircraft categorization (ie. find something of
            roughly similar size) after no match was found
            directly or via <code>related.txt</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED feature to Multiplay Lib to do this Doc8643 match also with matching
            airline livery.<br>
            This fix will mean that with a reasonable number of CSL packages
            installed nearly no plane will need to be rendered with the
            default plane (currently A320) provided the ICAO type code
            is included in the received tracking data.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/52">#52</a>:
            Multiplayer Lib: If <code>VERT_OFFSET</code> is not given in
            <code>xsb_aircraft.txt</code>
            files then it will default to a value between 1.2 and 5.5
            depending on Doc8643 aircraft categorization to avoid planes
            sliding on their belly.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED a new option <i>Any a/c id</i> to Settings / Labels, which displays
            the first non-empty field from <i>
                flight number, call sign,
                registration, transponder hex code.
            </i> Good as the one option
            to id an aircraft.

            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/54">#54</a>
            flight phase "Rotate": aircraft taking off should now
            in most cases rotate before take off and initially
            climb with pitch up.<br>
            Might also positively influence occurences of too steep take offs,
            but that was not initially targeted with this fix.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/55">#55</a>:
            Once an aircraft reaches an invalid position (like climbed too
            high with no more live tracking data available) it is now removed
            immediately. Reduces number of <code>CalcPPos: Ignoring invalid pos</code>
            debug messages in the log dramatically.
        </li>
        <li>
            UPDATED <code>related.txt</code>, especially in
            the area of business jets and GA, still ongoing.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/49">#49</a>
            Settings / Advanced: Cleanup, moved debug options to bottom,
            added option for logging raw network data to <code>LTRawFD.log</code>.

            Started to change how LT looks for CSL directories. Will
            become a config option. Location will now default to
            <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code> <b>only</b>,
            but additional places can be added.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/52">#52 (still open)</a>
            a default of 3 for <code>VERT_OFFSET</code> if not given by <code>xsb_aircraft.txt</code>.
            That should be OK for mid-range jets, might be a bit high for GA which might
            appear hovering over ground. A better implementation to come which distinguishes
            five defaults by a/c classification.
