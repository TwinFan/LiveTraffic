    <h2>Release Notes</h2>

    <p>The number-link refers to the issue in GitHub with (technical) details.</p>
    
    <h3>v0.91.190120 Pubic Beta</h3>
    
    <b>To update coming from 0.90</b> or ealier:

    <ul>
        <li>
            The v0.91 package now ships with a directory <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/ShippedCSL</code>,
            which contains the X-CSL FollowMe Car courtesy of X-CSL.
            Move <code>ShippedCSL</code>
            under the existing <code>LiveTraffic/Resources</code> directory,
            in parallel to the existing <code>CSL</code> directory with the
            Bluebell installation.
        <li>
            If you had installed the X-CSL FollowMe car manually, then remove
            it now by deleting the <code>CARS</code> directory from
            your <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code> directory.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you ever had trouble with "ghost planes" (seeing yellow labels
            without aircrafts) then likely your Bluebell CSL installation has been
            damaged, possibly by the X-CSL installation. Recommendation is
            to start over: Clear the <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code>
            directory and download the Bluebell package once again,
            following the
            <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/installation#bluebell-obj8-csl-packages">installation documentation</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <P>Resulting folder structure shall be:
<pre><code>
    LiveTraffic
    - 64              (.xpl binaries)
    - Resources
      - CSL           (for Bluebell installation)
      - ShippedCSL
        - XCSL_CARS   (contains the FollowMe car as included in the package now)
</code></pre>
            
    <P>Release content:</P>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            ADDED FollowMe Car into the LiveTraffic package, courtesy of X-CSL.
            No need to install this model any longer from X-CSL.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>v0.90.190118 Pubic Beta - Hot Fix</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            ADDED a delay between requests to OpenSky Master data channel to
            avoid HTTP 503 Service Unavailable responses.
        </li>
        <li>FIXED error handling of OpenSky Master data channel, so that too
            many errors now do lead to channel deactivation as per design.
        </li>
        <li>FIXED requesting routes from OpenSky: Don't query call signs with spaces
            as they lead to HTTP 400 Bad Request. (Could probably be replaced
            with &percnt;20, but for these call signs there aren't any routes anyway
            so just safe that network traffic.)
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>v0.90.190117 Public Beta</h3>
    
    No change beside the version number.

    <h3>v0.86.20190112 Public Beta candidate</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            NEW <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/37">#37</a>
            flight route number and routing information from OpenSky,
            which takes priority over routing info from ADS-B Exchange.
            This is the first time flight numbers of commercial flights
            become available. Note that such info is manually maintained by
            OpenSky supporters based on call signs. You can report wrong routes
            in the flight detail window of their
            <a href="https://opensky-network.org/network/explorer">OpenSky Explorer</a>
            if you have an OpenSky login.
        </li>
        <li>
            NEW <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/53">#53</a>
            configuration for label colors in "Settings > A/C Labels".
        </li>
        <li>
            NEW <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/42">#42</a>
            tab "Settings > CSL" for configuration of up to 7
            CSL paths, and standard codes for default aircraft and ground
            vehicles.
        </li>
        <li>
            NEW "CSL model" info in A/C information window.
        </li>
        <li>
            UPDATED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/38">#38</a>,
            <code>related.txt</code> with twin engine props, GA, and
            helicopter codes.
        </li>
        <li>
            UPDATED <code>Doc8643.txt</code> file to January 2019, better
            replacement of unicode characters
            (similar character instead of just ?).
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/66">#66</a>,
            which removes deprecated code for Macs around file system access.
            This is pure code refactoring and shall not influence functionality.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>v0.85.20190106</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/60">#60</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/67">#67</a>
            aircraft too high on final and turning 180 degrees on touch-down (I hope).
            This is yet another significant change to the handling, analysis, cleansing, and
            landing/take off prediction code of flight tracking data.
            New isse will require new data for analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/63">#63</a>
            Label text size with HDR and antialiasing settings SSAA and higher.
			Involves a hack of reading <code>X-Plane.prf</code> file to find out
            about current settings. Try playing with "Visual Effetcs" and
            "Antialiasing" sliders in XP11.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/53">#53</a>
            color of labels for Airbus to red...which at the moment is just a proof-of-concept
            that LT can set individual colors. Will become configurable in future release.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED AGL text to "GND_ON" when on ground in A/C info wnd and labels.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>v0.84.20181229 Intermediate Release</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            NEW <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/62">#62</a>
            feature 'auto-select' for A/c Info Window. Can be activated via new
            menu command <code>Aircraft Info (Auto-select)</code> or by typing
            'AUTO' into an open info window's edit field.<br>
            Indicated by trailing text '(AUTO)' in title bar.<br>
            Window will follow the closest a/c in view, slightly prefering
            a/c straight ahead over a/c to the side.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/61">#61</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/43">#43</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/58">#58</a>:
            In a multi-channel configuration, OpenSky now has priority when
            creating a/c, meaning: if both channels
            'see' an aircraft before it is actually created then OpenSky
            will be the channel LiveTraffic prefers. Reason is on average
            worse quality of unconsolidated ADS-B Exchange data.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/48">#48</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/57">#57</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/58">#58</a>:
            Further enhanced flight data cleansing. Mostly affects data from
            ADS-B Exchange, which don't seem to be consolidated on the server.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>v0.84.20181224</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/61">#61</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/43">#43</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/58">#58</a>:
            Better handling of mixed channels. Please run with all channels
            enabled. A/c will at any point in time be fed by one channel
            only, but switching to another is possible if (a) the original
            channel stopped feeding and (b) the new position is in a
            reasonable direction to prevent 180 degree turns.<br>
            As channels aren't time-synched LT needs to make up for the
            reported time difference with unusual slow/fast plane movements.<br>
            A channel switch will be document with a DEBUG-level <code>Log.txt</code>
            entry like <code>
                DEBUG AA73C3 (SWA1730): SWITCHED CHANNEL from
                'ADSB Exchange Live Online' to 'OpenSky Live Online'
            </code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/48">#48</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/57">#57</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/58">#58</a>:
            Flight data cleansing introduced, which tries to remove
            ill-looking positions from the position queue.
            This shall lead to a lot less 180 degree turns and other
            weird movements. It will not remove all weird behaviour, though.<br>
            A position removal will be document with a DEBUG-level <code>Log.txt</code>
            entry like <code>DEBUG A25CDC (SKW4148): Removed an invalid position</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED default configuration: Auto-Start enabled, all channels enabled.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/37">#37 (still open)</a>:
            A/c info wnd displays origin/dest airport info as reported
            by ADS-B-Exchange. No interpretation...if wrong refer to ADSBEx.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/64">#64</a>:
            Fixed using correct altitude value from OpenSky stream,
            specifically: geo altitude instead of barometric altitude.
            Should lead to OpenSky a/c better hit runway threshold.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED: Enhancements to take-off prediction. Should more often and
            more smoothly see rotate phase right before take off.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/56">#56</a>
            reading <code>[CSLPaths]</code> in <code>LiveTraffic.prf</code>
            containing spaces. Tested/fixed full path usage on Mac.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED Config file entries for <code>DEFAULT_AC_TYPE A320</code> and
            <code>DEFAULT_CAR_TYPE ZZZC</code> to <code>LiveTraffic.prf</code>
            to specify ICAO types to use when (a) no a/c type could be
            determined and (b) for cars.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/51">#51</a>
            identification of ground vehicles in flight data and display of them
            using the type configured with <code>DEFAULT_CAR_TYPE</code> in
            <code>LiveTraffic.prf</code>. Requires such a type as a
            CSL model. Tested with <a href="http://csl.x-air.ru/info/item/150?lang_id=43">
                this model
            </a>.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>v0.83.20181212</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/44">#44 (still open)</a>
            a bug in Multiplayer Lib preventing to find a match based
            on Doc8643 aircraft categorization (ie. find something of
            roughly similar size) after no match was found
            directly or via <code>related.txt</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED feature to Multiplay Lib to do this Doc8643 match also with matching
            airline livery.<br>
            This fix will mean that with a reasonable number of CSL packages
            installed nearly no plane will need to be rendered with the
            default plane (currently A320) provided the ICAO type code
            is included in the received tracking data.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/52">#52</a>:
            Multiplayer Lib: If <code>VERT_OFFSET</code> is not given in
            <code>xsb_aircraft.txt</code>
            files then it will default to a value between 1.2 and 5.5
            depending on Doc8643 aircraft categorization to avoid planes
            sliding on their belly.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED a new option <i>Any a/c id</i> to Settings / Labels, which displays
            the first non-empty field from <i>
                flight number, call sign,
                registration, transponder hex code.
            </i> Good as the one option
            to id an aircraft.
        </li>
        <li>
            FIXED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/54">#54</a>
            flight phase "Rotate": Aircrafts taking off should now
            in most cases rotate before take off and initially
            climb with pitch up.<br>
            Might also positively influence occurences of too steep take offs,
            but that was not initially targeted with this fix.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/55">#55</a>:
            Once an aircraft reaches an invalid position (like climbed too
            high with no more live tracking data available) it is now removed
            immediately. Reduces number of <code>CalcPPos: Ignoring invalid pos</code>
            debug messages in the log dramatically.
        </li>
        <li>
            UPDATED <code>related.txt</code>, especially in
            the area of business jets and GA, still ongoing.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/49">#49</a>
            Settings / Advanced: Cleanup, moved debug options to bottom,
            added option for logging raw network data to <code>LTRawFD.log</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>v0.82.20181208</h3>

    <P>
        This version does not solve any issue completely but lays the
        foundation to do so with the next version.
    </P>

    <ul>
        <li>
            CHANGED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/38">#38 (still open)</a>:
            Reorganized Resources directory, <b>now also includes <code>FlightModels.prf</code></b>,
            <code>Doc8643.txt</code> regenerated from scratch, current as of November 2018,
            <code>related.txt</code> reworked in large parts (smaller planes yet to do).
            All comes completely with the LT package.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/44">#44 (still open)</a>:
            Identify, log, accept a/c master data without ICAO type code,
            but will still be rendered as A320.
        </li>
        <li>
            CHANGED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/42">#42 (still open)</a>:
            Started to change how LT looks for CSL directories. Will
            become a config option. Location will now default to
            <code>LiveTraffic/Resources/CSL</code> <b>only</b>,
            but additional places can be added.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/52">#52 (still open)</a>
            a default of 3 for <code>VERT_OFFSET</code> if not given by <code>xsb_aircraft.txt</code>.
            That should be OK for mid-range jets, might be a bit high for GA which might
            appear hovering over ground. A better implementation to come which distinguishes
            five defaults by a/c classification.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>v0.81.20181202</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/39">#39</a>
            easier usage of LiveTraffic and XSquawkBox in parallel.
            See new topic on

            </a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            ADDED <a href="https://github.com/TwinFan/LiveTraffic/issues/40">#40</a>
            support for MacOS versions before 10.14 Mojave.
            10.12 Sierra confirmed by tester.
            Should work down to 10.9 Mavericks.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>v0.80.20181130</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>First version offered to selected beta testers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Essential Installation</h2>

    <h3>LiveTraffic plugin</h3>

    <P>
        The <code>LiveTraffic</code> plugin folder is to be copied into X-Plane's
        <code>Resources/plugins</code> folder, the same as with other plugins.
    </P>

    <h3>CSL Packages</h3>
    <P>
        You must install CSL packages, otherwise there will be no
        aircraft models to display and LiveTraffic will fail to
        start up.
    </P>
    <P>
        Recommended are
        <ul>

                <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/37041-bluebell-obj8-csl-packages/">X-Plane.org forums</a>.
                Follow their instructions. Also download and install the
                <code>BB_IVAO_vert_offsets_*</code> files in the downloads as recommended
                for the X-IvAp users. LiveTraffic can handle them, too.
