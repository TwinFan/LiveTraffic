LiveTraffic 1.0

# LiveTraffic FlightModels configuration file

# The file is divided into [sections]. First there are an arbitrary number
# of sections defining flight models.
# The last section has the defined name [Map] and maps these flight models
# with actual aircraft types.

# These values are also the hard-coded defaults in case
# the entire config file went missing.

[Map]
# The Map section matches flight models (defined previously,
# so [Map] has to be last) with aircraft types.
#
# First word is the name of the flight model.
#
# The remainder of the line is considered a regular expression supposed to
# match an aircraft type string made up of:
#     WTC;Classification;Type Designator;Model;Manufacturer
# with 'Classification' being a combination of Description, Engine Type,
# Engine Count in a 3-letter/digit code.
#
# Examples: Airbus A380, Boing 737-200, Dash 8, Beechcraft Baron 58,
# Cessna C172 Skyhawk, and the special designator entry for gliders
# respectively look like this:
#
#  H;L4J;A388;A-380-800;AIRBUS
#  M;L2J;B732;737-200;BOEING
#  M;L2T;DH8A;CT-142 Dash 8;DE HAVILLAND CANADA
#  L;L2P;BE58;58 Baron;BEECH
#  L;L1P;C172;172 Skyhawk;CESSNA
#  -;-;GLID;Glider;(ANY MANUFACTURER)
#
# See https://www.icao.int/publications/doc8643 for details and all
# registered values.
# LiveTraffic takes the aircraft types from the Doc8643.txt file.
#
# The idea is to define a flight model which matches a wide range of aircrafts,
# like 'huge jets', 'medium jets', 'regional commuters', 'general aviation'.
#
# Then for a given aircraft as per live flight data LiveTraffic has to find a
# matching model. And it does so by computing the above aircraft type string
# for the given aircraft and then walk from top to bottom through this list
# and take the first model whose pattern matches the computed type string.
#
# It is possible, allowed, and propably helpful to list a
# flight model name several times at different positions in the list
# with different patterns.
